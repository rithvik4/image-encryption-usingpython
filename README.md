image encryption using python

Image encryption is the process of converting an image into a scrambled and unreadable form using an encryption algorithm. This is done to protect the image from unauthorized access or tampering. In the digital world, images are vulnerable to cyber threats such as hacking, unauthorized access, and data theft. Image encryption helps prevent these threats by encrypting the image and making it difficult for anyone to access or modify it without the appropriate decryption key.
